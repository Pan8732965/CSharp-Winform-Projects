## 1.Guessing Game:
**Type:Windows Form**  
### *Introduction:*
This Project is inspired by the program in my C repo. So it's the program that I want to make it with GUI for a long time.  
Now, I finally made it!(Although the interface looks very simple).But I still want to add some functions in it,maybe next time I'll back to work in this project.  
So this is what the interface looks like:
