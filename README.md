## ==My Projects==
**Attention:  
*Before using and editing,must download .Net core and .net framework 4.8 first or the exe file can't open***
## 1.Guessing Game:
**Type:Windows Form**  
### *Introduction:*
This Project is inspired by the program in my C language repo. So it's the program that I want to make it with GUI for a long time.  
Now, I finally made it!(Although the interface looks very simple).But I still want to add some features in it,maybe next time I'll back to work in this project.  
So this is what the interface looks like:

### *Features to add:*
- The interface can show the numbers that user input.
- Input number can click **Enter** with the **numericupdown** object.
## 2.GUI Calculator:
**Type:Windows Form**
### *Introduction:*
This  project is also inspired in my C language repo.The GUI interface that I take reference is from the calc which is develop by msft on windows10.  
And I also take reference from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X67eC9jf2uE) because I don't even know how to start and coding.So based on this,I think it's the second important project in my whole repo. Of course,this program is now still have lots of bugs and issues that waiting to fix.  
This the interface looks like:

### *Bugs to fix:*  
- keypressed problem
- When muitipy two numbers and clicked x^2, it'll went wrong
- Second time to calculate ,the value will changed into 0
## 3.Music Player:
**Type:Windows Form**
### *Introduction:*
This Project is the most complicated one in this repo.Not the code is complicated,is the bugs and program buliding itself. So I'll try my best to fix the bugs and add some features that I want.  
The decoder that I use is Windows Media Player.And I'm not directly use **Winodws Media Player** interface in this program,instead I use button to contact the program.  
And this is the GUI interface looks like: 
- Welcome:<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62552984/103358907-ba69c600-4af1-11eb-9e3a-9b715ea0f62e.png" width="300" length="120"> 
- Playing Music:<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62552984/103358893-b473e500-4af1-11eb-88e5-d8a1fe31d173.png" width="300" length="120">  
Yes,the interface looks very original because this project is't completly finished.

### *Bugs to fix:*
- When hit the stop mp3 button it's can't show the name of the song
- Audio switcher can't follow the switcher to decrease the music volume
- List box can't display musics name
- When the **show_text** set to **autosize**,the white stuff will block the text.
### *Features to add:*
- Music wave(impossible)
- Audio switcher
- Combine play and pause button when hit the button  
- Music List box
### ==============
**In the end,I wish I can fix the bugs all in this repo,and add the features that I actually want.**
